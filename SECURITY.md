# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take all security issues seriously. I appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a vulnerability, please email me at [info@timokoessler.de](mailto:info@timokoessler.de) with the full details, including steps to reproduce the issue. You can use my [PGP key](https://timokoessler.de/pgp-key.txt) or my [S/MIME key](https://timokoessler.de/smime.txt) to encrypt the email. Please write the email in English or German.

I will check the vulnerability as soon as possible and get back to you within 48 hours. If the vulnerability is accepted, I will publish a security advisory and release a patch as soon as possible. Please do not disclose the vulnerability until I have published a security advisory. I will give you credit for your responsible disclosure in the advisory.
